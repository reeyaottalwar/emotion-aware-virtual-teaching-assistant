### **Emotion-Aware Virtual Teaching Assistant using facial ER and voice ER**

This project is a virtual teaching assistant that uses emotion recognition technology to provide a more personalized and supportive learning experience. By analyzing a student's emotional state through their facial expressions, the assistant can adapt its teaching style, offer timely encouragement, or suggest a break to prevent frustration.

-----

### **Features**

  * **Real-time Emotion Detection:** Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to detect a student's emotions (e.g., happy, sad, confused, frustrated).
  * **Adaptive Feedback:** Provides tailored responses based on the detected emotion. For example, if a student appears confused, the assistant can re-explain a concept in a different way.
  * **Interactive Learning Modules:** Includes built-in lessons on various subjects with a focus on human-centered design.
  * **Progress Tracking:** Logs emotional data over time to help educators understand a student's engagement and identify areas where they may be struggling.
